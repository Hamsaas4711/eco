          About KPT Eco Club <FaTree color="#388e3c" />
        </h2>
        <p>
          The KPT Eco Club is a student-driven initiative dedicated to promoting
          sustainability and environmental awareness across the Karnataka
          Polytechnic campus in Mangalore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to encourage eco-conscious behavior through activities
          like tree planting, waste management, and awareness drives. Together,
          we aim to create a cleaner, greener future.
        </p>

            <h3>Community Engagement</h3>
            <p>
              We believe that lasting change starts with community. Our club
              organizes workshops, clean-up drives, and events to bring people
              together for environmental causes.

            <h3>Tree Plantation Drives</h3>
            <p>
              Planting trees is one of the most effective ways to combat climate
              change. We actively plant native species across the campus and
              surrounding areas.

            <h3>Waste Management</h3>
            <p>
              Promoting recycling and reducing waste is central to our efforts.
              We work to improve waste segregation awareness and encourage
              reuse.
